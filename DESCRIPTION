Description: Performs the O2PLS data integration method for two datasets yielding joint and data-specific parts for each dataset.
    The algorithm automatically switches to a memory-efficient approach to fit O2PLS to high dimensional data.
    It provides a rigorous and a faster alternative cross-validation method to select the number of components,
    as well as functions to report proportions of explained variation and to construct plots of the results.
